RHYHM ATTACK
____________

This is a simple rhythm game where you have to hit the notes at the right time in order to score points.
Each of these songs / tunes sound different so you will have to listen out to the beat to knoe when to
press at the right time.

Symbolism behind this

Just like the player is determined to get a higher score, hackers are determined to get access to your data.
A longer password as will be seen by the audio will take longer than a shorter one to crack, and a more
sophisticated password

About the code
______________
New thing I learnt for this project was constants and classes. I used a constant to manage the different
screens which would have been very useful for my prior assignment if I had known about it as it allows
the person using the webpage to switch back and forth allowing for all sort of stuff to be displayed.

Another new thing was classes. These make it so that I dont need to write out each arrow over and over again
can just be written once and referred to multiple times.
