RHYHM ATTACK
____________

This is a simple rhythm game where you have to hit the notes at the right time in order to score points.
Each of these songs / tunes sound different so you will have to listen out to the beat to knoe when to
press at the right time.

Symbolism behind this
_____________________

Just like the player is determined to get a higher score, hacker's are determined to get access to your data.
A more secure passowrd as will be seen by the more complex audios will take longer than the more simplistic ones
to crack. Of course though, as the player progresses

About the code
______________
New thing I learnt for this project was constants. I used a constant to manage the different
screens which would have been very useful for my prior assignment if I had known about it. Constants allow for
me to have multiple screens and just switch back and forth when a condition is met. This prevents me from having
to re-write multiple lines and make my code a lot smaller.

Although not used or practiced yet, I would have like to try out classes. These make it so that I dont need to write
out each arrow over and over again, which would have worked perfectly for my original idea of a typical rhythm game of
numorous note syncing to a music's beat, amplitude, base and etc. It allows for an object to be written once and referred
to multiple times.

The assets
______________
As you can tell by the music, I am clearly a master of music theory and should be rivalling the greatest but being honest
it was fun but frustrating making music. Not having an ounce of music theory really did allow for me to make anything I wanted
to sound but for future, I will try to understand at least the basics to make some sort of beginner basic theme that is 
more pleasant to the ears.

For the arrows and the UI, It all came perfectly and drew inspiration from rhythm games with the colouring scheme
taking inspiration from none other than the 2000s Nokia 3310 to give that retro / device theme which fits the synth music.
